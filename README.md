# Transcribe_CABG
Transcribe project is a cardiac genomics project for comparing the association study outcomes of patients before and after "Coronary Artery Bypass Graft" surgery. The goal is hopefully to identify the functional cis and trans elements triggered by ischemia or other suergical conditions.
